# kpfm-matlab
## Short description: 
Batch open matlab .txt files, track a point through multiple frames, output list of point positions tracked through frames.

## Long Description
These functions are designed to work in conjunction with igor .txt files.  This program is designed to work in conjunction with Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) (on an Atomic Force Microscope or AFM) studies to track points through multiple AFM images and output a point (or average and standard deviation of multiple points) to a file.  This allows the Density of States (DOS) information to be gleaned from the outputted file after processing.
